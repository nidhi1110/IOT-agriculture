# IOT-agriculture
This project is at its initial stage.
The basic idea behind this project is to develop a method where one can monitor the weather and improve the yield.
In this project I have used the data from google (indirectly from weather.com) in order to get temperature,humidity,wind direction etc. of a particular region.
All the information is displayed on thingsboard dashboard with a graph representing the data and the json file has been directly exported from dashboard.
